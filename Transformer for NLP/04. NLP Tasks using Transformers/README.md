[In this notebook](https://github.com/regmi-saugat/TRANSFORMERS/blob/main/Transformer%20for%20NLP/04.%20NLP%20Tasks%20using%20Transformers/Transformer%20Tasks.ipynb) we have explore several kind of transformers using Hugging Face's pipeline for transformers

**Stanford Sentiment TreeBank (SST-2)** contains movie reviews. Using, SST on a Hugging Face transformers pipeline model we have run a simple binary classification problem

**Microsoft Research Paraphrases Corpus (MRPC)** contains pairs of sentences extracted from new sources on the web. Here, I have tried it using a Hugging Face BERT Model

**Winograd Schemas** Here, I have used the transformer model to solve a pronoun gender problem in an English-French Translation, where it produced the right answer
