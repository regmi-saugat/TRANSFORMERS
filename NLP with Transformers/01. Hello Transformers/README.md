## Hello Transformers
- This is a first chapter from the book Natural Language Processing with Transformers. In this notebook, I have implemented about Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Question Answering, Summarization, Translation and Text Generation using Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Transformers.


**Text Classification**

- Text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves categorizing or labeling a piece of text into predefined categories or classes. It's goal is to automatically analyze and assign a category or label to a given text document, such as an email, article, or tweet, based on its content.

**Named Entity Recognition**

-  It is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying named entities (i.e., specific entities with names) in text data. NER is an important subtask in information extraction and text analysis, as it helps in extracting structured information from unstructured text.

**Question Answering**

- In question answering, we provide the model with a passage of text called context, along with a question whose answer we'd like to extract. The model then returns the span of text corresponding to the answer.

**Summarization**

- The goal of text summarization is to take a long text as input and generate a short version with all the relevant facts.

**Translation**
- Like summarization, translation is a task where the output consists of generated text.

**Text Generation**

- It involves the automatic creation of coherent and contextually relevant text. It can encompass various types of text, including sentences, paragraphs, articles, stories, and more
